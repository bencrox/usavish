This is a fork form jailkit 2.14
==================================
http://olivier.sessink.nl/jailkit/

I highly recommend user to go to the official site instead.
Here is only my endeavor to firstly make a friendly version 
to be used in Ubuntu 11.04 VM instance, in practicular I will 
resolve the 64-bit files paths. So this should be no big deal 
at all. 

If it happened that I feel the progress is good, I will try 
to contact the jailkit-dev and feed back if there are any 
usable/patchable files. 

And I do this on GitHub mainly for recording the changes. 

Won't update frequently, do not expect from me :D
